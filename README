XDP quirks on various drivers/envs
==================================

Q: My #CPUs is higher than the number of NIC channels (e.g. 128 CPUs vs 63
   channels as pre-set maximums in ethtool -l).

   XDP_REDIRECT results in partial drops as a result. The latter was observed
   on mlx5 driver via:

   # perf probe -m mlx5_core -a 'mlx5e_xdp_xmit_ret=mlx5e_xdp_xmit%return ret=%ax'
   # perf record -e probe:mlx5e_xdp_xmit_ret__return -aR -g sleep 100
   # perf script

   [...]
   swapper     0 [127]  3009.821900: probe:mlx5e_xdp_xmit_ret__return: (ffffffffc4060dd0 <- ffffffffabc61d33) ret=0xfffffffa
   [...]

   The [127] shows the CPU number, ret=0xfffffffa is -ENXIO from mlx5e_xdp_xmit().

A: For mlx5 specifically, two things:

  1) Driver limitation, solved in the commit below [1], since kernel 5.10.

  2) Firmware / MSIX limitation, e.g. if ethtool -l shows 63 and not 64, we will
     need to use mlx mst tools to allow more MSIX for the function.

  A) Ensure latest NIC firmware is used, e.g:
     https://www.mellanox.com/support/firmware/connectx5en

  B) Install mft tools package:
  Download: https://www.mellanox.com/products/adapter-software/firmware-tools

  Start mst module:
  Doc: https://docs.nvidia.com/networking/display/MFT4130/Linux
  $ mst start
  $ mst status

  Query Current msix config:
  Doc: https://docs.nvidia.com/networking/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=19798347
  $ mlxconfig -d /dev/mst/mt4117_pciconf0 --enable_verbosity q | grep NUM_PF_MSIX

  Set desired new MSIX for PF:
  $ mlxconfig -d /dev/mst/mt4117_pciconf0 set NUM_PF_MSIX=128
  $ reboot

  Bump the number of channels via ethtool:
  $ ethtool -L eth0 combined 128

  In case the NIC only supports up to 127 combined channels, the IRQ affinity
  script from this repo can be used to exclude CPU 128 from packet processing:
  $ ./affinity.sh eth0 0-126

  After that, no drops should be observed anymore.

    net/mlx5: Increase the max number of channels to 128
    
    Currently the max number of channels is limited to 64, which is half of
    the indirection table size to allow some flexibility. But on servers
    with more than 64 cores, users may want to utilize more queues.
    
    This patch increases the advertised max number of channels to 128 by
    changing the ratio between channels and indirection table slots to 1:1.
    At the same time, the driver still enable no more than 64 channels at
    loading. Users can change it by ethtool afterwards.
